    {
      "question": "What is SMILES validation?",
      "answer": "SmartAdd includes real-time SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) validation. When entering molecular structures using SMILES notation, the system validates the syntax and structure to ensure accuracy before export."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add multiple samples to a reaction?",
      "answer": "Yes! You can add multiple samples to reactions with automatic smart sorting. The system intelligently organizes samples based on their roles (reactant/product/solvent) and allows you to define reaction scheme types for proper visualization in Chemotion."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does direct upload to Chemotion work?",
      "answer": "When you choose 'Upload to Chemotion ELN' from the export menu, you'll be prompted to enter your Chemotion server URL, username, and password. The system verifies server connectivity and authenticates your credentials before uploading your collection directly, eliminating the need for manual file downloads and imports."
